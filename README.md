### Week 2: Monday, September 17, 2018

Homework Review
- What did you learn from Shiffman's videos?

Intro to p5.js
- [Here's the p5.js reference](http://p5js.org/reference).
- `function setup` and `function draw`
- (`x`,`y`) coordinates and the Cartesian plane

#### Workshop: Building Blocks of Code -- functions

You give the computer commands by first writing the name of the command, like
`background`, followed by a comma-separated list, in parentheses, containing
the parameters for the function: that is, how the function should be run.

Think of the command **"Do some pushups!"** You might ask: **"how many
pushups?"** -- that number is a parameter to the command. It tells you
something about how to perform the command. Same is true in JavaScript / p5.

Here's the sample code we wrote to replicate Piet Mondrian's classic
*Composition II*:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(240);
    noStroke();
    strokeCap(SQUARE);

    // blue square
    fill(0, 0, 255);
    rect(0, 320, 80, 80);

    // red square
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    rect(80, 0, 320, 320);

    // yellow square
    fill(255, 255, 0);
    rect(370, 360, 30, 40);

    stroke(0);
    strokeWeight(10);
    line(80, 0, 80, 400);     // left line
    line(0, 320, 400, 320);   // middle line
    line(370, 320, 370, 400); // right

    strokeWeight(15);
    line(370, 360, 400, 360); // bottom

    strokeWeight(20);
    line(0, 160, 80, 160);
}
```

Copy and paste it to a local file using your code editor, or run it on the [P5 web editor](http://editor.p5js.org). (Either way, make sure to save frequently!)

1. Look up all the functions you don't know in the [p5.js
reference](http://p5js.org/reference). Use the example code
for each function to guide your exploration into what those
functions do.

2. Modify this code, or come up with new code, that generates other work in the
style of Mondrian. Be as accurate as you like in [chanelling Mondrian's own
process](https://www.theartstory.org/artist-mondrian-piet.htm)!

3. Add some randomness: use the `random` function (look it up in the
reference!) to make your sketch different each time it runs...

#### Building Blocks of Code: variables

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(240);

    noStroke();

    let red = color(220, 0, 0);
    let blue = color(0, 120, 255);
    let yellow = color(255, 235, 0);

    let leftLineX = 80;
    let lowerLineY = 320;
    let rightLineX = 370;
    let upperShortLineY = 150;
    let lowerShortLineY = 360;

    fill(blue);
    rect(0, lowerLineY, leftLineX, height - lowerLineY);

    fill(red);
    rect(leftLineX, 0, width - leftLineX, lowerLineY);

    fill(yellow);
    rect(rightLineX, lowerShortLineY, width - rightLineX, height - lowerShortLineY);

    stroke(0);
    strokeWeight(10);
    strokeCap(SQUARE);
    line(leftLineX, 0, leftLineX, height);
    line(0, lowerLineY, width, lowerLineY);
    line(rightLineX, lowerLineY, rightLineX, height);

    strokeWeight(20);
    line(0, upperShortLineY, leftLineX, upperShortLineY);

    strokeWeight(15);
    line(rightLineX, lowerShortLineY, width, lowerShortLineY);
}
```

Here's a different version of the code that produces the exact same canvas.
What's different about it? **Names!**

Our previous code was a sea of numbers. If you wanted to move a point or line
intersection around on that drawing, you had to find all the places in the code
that referred to that point -- not an easy task! -- and change them in concert.

This **variable** approach here **names** some of the key locations on the
canvas and lets us change them everywhere they're used in a drawing command by
changing the number itself in **only one place**. p5.js already gives you some
variables to work with, including `width` and `height`, used above to refer to
the width and height of the canvas.

Naming is a very useful tool in our **abstraction** toolkit.

1. Try changing the canvas size in the code above and observe what happens. Why
does this happen? (What happened when you changed the canvas size in the
original, non-variable code?

2. Explore some of the other variables the p5.js provides. `mouseX` and
`mouseY` are a fun interactive pairing!

#### Animations

One use of variables, explored above, is to name information and use that name
to link other components together.

Another use of variables is to track information about an animation as it
progresses.

For example, to move a circle across the screen, we might consider code like
this:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

var x = 10;

function draw() {
    background(220);

    ellipse(x, 200, 40);

    x = x + 3;
}
```

In an animation, your computer draws frames at a fixed rate (called,
appropriately, the *frame rate*). In p5.js, you are responsible for telling p5
what to draw each frame: you put that drawing code inside the `draw` function.
Each frame, p5.js runs your `draw` function and copies whatever it draws to the
screen.

To make a smooth animation, we want each frame to look *mostly* like the
previous frame, but with a small difference. The code above does that: each
frame, the circle is draw 3 pixels further to the right. The code tracks the
position of the circle with the `x` variable, whose value persists across
frames -- so each frame, `x` is increased by 3.

The code above does what we want, but it's very one-shot: after the circle
reaches the right edge of the canvas, it's over.

We can use an `if` statement -- a condition-checking piece of code -- to help
us reset the circle's position if it reaches the right edge of the screen, like
in the following code:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

var x = 10;

function draw() {
    background(220);

    ellipse(x, 200, 40);

    x = x + 3;

    if (x > width) {
        x = 10;
    }
}
```

The `if` condition is checked every frame, and when (if?) `x` ever reaches the
value of `width` -- 400 in this case, because that's the canvas width -- then
`x` is reset to 10.

But that's just a reset. What if we want the circle to move backwards across
the screen?

That's a second thing we need to track: the motion of the circle itself. We can
make a new variable that tracks how many pixels per frame the circle moves, and
then change that variable whenever the circle reaches a canvas boundary.

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

var x = 10;
var changeInX = 3;

function draw() {
    background(220);

    ellipse(x, 200, 40);

    x = x + changeInX;

    if (x > width) {
        changeInX = -3;
    }

    if (x < 0) {
        changeInX = 3;
    }
}
```
